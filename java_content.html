        <h2> Java Script is what gives the page its functions and you can think of it as the brain. 
            A restaurant has menus and the waiter takes your order and takes it to the kitchen, they 
            deliver the product to you when its done cooking in the kitchen. Java script can be compared
            to waiters as they carry out functions and give you a result.
